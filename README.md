## Introduction
Bitsliced Implementations of Lightweight Block Ciphers on AVR 8-bit Microcontrollers

This is a program to implement lightweight block ciphers on AVR 8-bit microcontrollers.
Several algorithms have been implemented: [PRINCE](http://eprint.iacr.org/2012/529), [LED](http://eprint.iacr.org/2012/600), [RECTANGLE](http://eprint.iacr.org/2014/084), [SIMON and SPECK](http://eprint.iacr.org/2015/585), [PRIDE](http://eprint.iacr.org/2014/453). All of the implementation are written in assembly code and can be compiled using Atmel Studio 6.2. All of them have verified the test vectors provided in the cipher specifications.
