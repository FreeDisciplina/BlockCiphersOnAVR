## Introduction
Bitsliced Implementations of the PRINCE, LED and RECTANGLE Block Ciphers on AVR 8-bit Microcontrollers

This is a program to implement lightweight block ciphers on AVR 8-bit microcontrollers.
Several algorithms have been implemented: [PRINCE](http://eprint.iacr.org/2012/529.pdf), [LED](https://eprint.iacr.org/2012/600.pdf), [RECTANGLE](https://eprint.iacr.org/2014/084.pdf), [SIMON and SPECK](http://eprint.iacr.org/2015/585), [PRIDE](http://eprint.iacr.org/2014/453.pdf). All of the implementation are written in assembly code and can be compiled using Atmel Studio 6.2. All of them have verified the test vectors provided in the cipher specifications.
